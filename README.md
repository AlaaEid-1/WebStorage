# Hello in Our Project WebStorage
##  üí°[***WebStorage***](https://github.com/AlaaEid-1/WebStorage)

# app Characteristic (general architecture): 
## First, the project is a website that allows the user to upload images. The site consists of 4 pages:

1-	The first page is the image download page, which allows the user to deal with the image upload as a Key and value, where the key is the name and value is the image.
Here the name is entered, and the name is not repeated, then the image is entered, and the image extension is (png, jpg, jpeg), and if other than this extension is entered, a message appears (Please choose png or jpg or jpeg file) and a button for upload image.

2-	The second page is the image display page, where when the image is loaded on the first page, then it is stored in the data base and the file, then the image is displayed in the view data page in a table. This page displays the name of the image and the image in a table, where there are two buttons in front of each image (Edit, Delete)
    ‚Ä¢	The first button is the delete button, where if the delete button is pressed for the image corresponding to the button, the row containing the image and image name is deleted, as the image is deleted from the view data page and the data base.
    ‚Ä¢	The second button is the edit button (this button takes us to another page, which is the edit page), where when we want to modify the image and replace it with a second image, an image is added to the key and replaced in the data base and view data page.

3-	The third page is the search page, where when we want to search for a key, the image is displayed, and if a search is made for a key that is not present in the data base, no image is displayed, and the message ‚Äúthe key is not present in the data base‚Äù is displayed, and there is a filter button that displays all data as well.

4-	The fourth page is the memory cash page, and the size capacity of cash is displayed, and the hit and miss page is displayed.
